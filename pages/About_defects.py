They usually come from slag or oxidized particles that did not completely melt. 
These create small internal flaws or surface disruptions and weaken the steel structurally."""

They appear as small, deep round holes or indentations that damage the smooth finish. 
This defect can significantly affect the appearance and coating performance of the steel."""

get pressed into the steel strip instead of being cleaned off. 
This creates rough, dark spots on the surface that affect appearance and quality."""

during processing, handling, or transport. 
They reduce the visual quality of steel and can be entry points for corrosion if left untreated."""

They may result from surface contamination, cooling irregularities, or defects in coating processes. 
Patches can create weak spots and irregular textures in the material."""

It usually forms due to rapid cooling, stress release, or thermal shock. 
Though often shallow, it can indicate underlying structural stress in the steel."""
